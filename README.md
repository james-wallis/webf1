## Requirement Notes
Topic Website An electronic portfolio for your work, written in HTML5 and CSS.

Content:
1. Your literature review,
marked up in HTML.
2. A work log describing the
work you’ve undertaken in
WebF1 over the year.
3. A short (5-10 seconds),
video that
works on the current
version of all major
desktop browsers
4. An image.

_Note: Your literature review should be
comprehensively marked up – merely
including a link to a non-HTML version is not
suitable!_

All pages must:
1. be marked up using valid semantic
HTML5 (i.e aim for descriptive and
not procedural markup).
2. include a link to the W3C validator (
http://validator.w3.org ) enabling
readers to check that the referring
page is valid.
3. be formatted using CSS (i.e. form
and content are separated).

Navigation: It should be clear (e.g. through a
structured menu) how your site
could be expanded to showcase
your other works as you progress
through your course.

The pages must be linked.

You must provide a means of usable and
accessible navigation for your content.
